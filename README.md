## Brief

---

Produce a sample of our BeYou website
Using your development skills we would like you to reproduce the attached web design in Shopify (preferred option) or HTML.
The design is currently in ‘invision’ an on-line platform that will allow you to inspect the colours, fonts and spacing used within the design. You will be required to ‘request access’ by clicking the ‘</>’ symbol at the bottom right and create an account.

Objective
Re-create the design as close as possible in a responsive manner, for both desktop and mobile.

Challenge
Good execution and clean code.

## Notes:

#### Carousel Implementation

Flickety does not support wrapping content corectly when the total width of all available content is smaller than it's container, [and likely never will](https://github.com/metafizzy/flickity/issues/95).

To get around this, the 3 products have been doubled up and rather than using Flickety's built in page dots (because it was showing 6 dots for 6 products), I made my own instead.
